        <h1>Understanding Reading Difficulty</h1>
        <p>The Flesch Reading Ease Test is used to quantify how difficult it is to read a specific text based on a
            100-point scale. Higher scores translate into easier to understand text passages, while lower scores mean
            that a passage is harder to read. Below, is the Flesch Reading Ease Formula for calculating the difficulty
            of a passage:</p>

        </div>


        <p> Rather than just <i>telling</i> people how difficult a passage is to read by giving them a numerical score,
            I saw an opportunity to educate people about the underlying factors that directly contribute to the overall
            reading
            difficulty of a given passage as calculated by the Flesch Reading Ease Test. Using a collection of fairy
            tales from <i>The Project Gutenberg EBook of
                English Fairy Tales</i>, my visualization aims to achieve this goal by accomplish the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>show users the Flesch Reading Ease scores for all Fairy Tales given</li>
            <li>illustrate the different factors that influence the overall
                Flesh Reading Difficulty score that is calculated
                <ul>
                    <li>Total Number of Words</li>
                    <li>Total Number of Sentences</li>
                    <li>Total Number of Syllables</li>
                    <li>Total Number of Complex Words, <i>where a complex word is defined as having 3 or more
                            syllables</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>allow users to compare two stories in order to observe how the different readability scores are
                the
                result of different values of factors.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Because the Flesch Reading Ease equation calculates its score based off the <b>average number of words per
                sentence</b> and the <b>average syllables per word</b>, this means that one story having more total
            words than the other does not necessarily mean that it will be more difficult to read. The same can be said
            for the total number of sentences, total number of syllables, and total number of complex words. Of the four
            factors that this visualization illustrates, you will notice that the total number of complex words is the
            only factor not present in the Flesch Reading Ease equation. This factor was included in this visualization
            because it still directly affects the overall score since a higher number of complex words will contribute
            to a higher number of total syllables, which increases the reading difficulty of a passage.
