                <p>As a Google APM intern, I worked on Google’s Chromebook team where I led a cross-functional team
                    specializing in design, marketing, and engineering to launch “What’s New”, a new feature in ChromeOS
                    that highlights significant recent updates for Chromebooks. I guided my team through an extremely
                    tight set of deadlines by effectively communicating the needs of others, unblocking the engineering
                    team by coding a progressive web app to test our feature, and designing UI mocks to convey specs. In
                    the end, we launched to Beta and Stable channels, impacting ~XX million users, garnering positive
                    press.</p>

                <p> My other work involved creating a competitive analysis for iPadOS, researching Apple product
                    strategy and opportunities for leadership. I explored the motivations behind iPadOS, where Apple was
                    going, and how Google can respond accordingly.

                <h3>Google <span>May 2018 - August 2018</span></h3>
                <p>As a Google SWE intern, I worked on Google’s Cloud IoT platform within a team of SWEs, designers, and
                    PMs to overhaul the user interface for Google Cloud’s Internet of Things Platform, building and
                    launching a new “fleet monitoring” feature that creates insightful data visualizations that report
                    metrics for millions of IoT devices. </p>

                        IoT makes Device Activity Logging available</a></p>

                <p>To test my feature was working properly, I devised a way for
                    mocking device telemetry data to the IoT platform without the need for physical IoT devices. Along
                    the way, I also created technical help articles about unit testing and onboarding for nooglers. </p>

                <p> When my team ran into seemingly unsolvable technical issues, I would build relationships with
                    engineers
                    on other teams to figure out solutions to keep our feature on track, earning me a spot bonus from my
                    manager.

                <h2>Software Engineering intern</h2>
                <h3>NASA Johnson Space Center <span>June 2017 - August 2017</span></h3>
                <p>As a SWE intern at NASA JSC, I invented a real-time asset tracking system that uses bluetooth beacons
                    to track NASA assets throughout the Center’s 1,600 acre campus. Eventually, my tracking system
                    received ~$10,000 to be implemented as a campus-wide bike tracking program, winning the NASA JSC
                    Director’s Choice Award. The company who created the beacon technology, Estimote, wrote an article
                    featuring my work: bit.ly/estimote-bike-article. After my internship, I coordinated with NASA the
                    bike tracking program to ~300 bikes. Today, I still do technical consulting for the project.</p>

                        JSC transcends space and time with custom built bike tracking system</a></p>

                <p> Because there was no way to find specific buildings on the NASA JSC campus online, I created
                    jscmap.com, a progressive web app that personnel use to navigate around NASA. I was recognized by
                    JSC’s Director of Center Operations for saving NASA ~$200,000 in predicted costs associated with
                    having to build a native iOS/android application. To this day, jscmap.com is featured in every
                    intern onboarding presentation.
