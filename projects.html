            <p>GeoXplorer is a mobile app that enables users to “Xplore” a wide range of 3D models from Earth,
                the Moon, and Mars using Augmented Reality. </p>

            <p>GeoXplorer features a catalogue of different 3D models you
                can pick to view in AR.These models are split into four categories: Martian Models, Crystal Lattice,
                Digital Elevation Models, and Hand Samples. Once you select and download a model, you can point and tap
                anywhere on the world around you to view the 3D model in AR.</p>

            <p>If the model is too small or maybe not oriented correctly, GeoXplorer offers controls that allow you to
                manipulate the size, elevation, and rotation of the model.</p>

            <p>GeoXplorer is currently only available for iOS. Android support coming soon!</p>

            <p>GeoBase is a React app that planetary scientists use to browse, download, and upload 3D models. Using
                three.js, GeoBase loads high-fidelity 3D models directly into your browser window, allowing you to drag
                and rotate the models to examine them. Each 3D model is around 30MB, which presented a considerable
                challenge when trying to view models in your browser without crashing anything. Because JavaScript is
                single-threaded, I employed the use of Web Workers to load the 3D models on a background thread so the
                UI doesn't freeze. Uploading large 3D models also presented another challenge as file uploads would
                often become corrupted. I solved this issue by using the <a
                    href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system">NodeJS File system API ('fs') </a>to break up
                big
                files into smaller packets using <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream">streams</a>.

            <p>The Fossett Lab for Virtual Planetary Exploration has nearly one terrabyte of high-fidelity 3D models of
                Earth and Martian terrain. I built out the entire backend infrastructure for the Lab, moving all 3D
                models to Azure Blob Storage. I then created a REST API that allows us to POST and GET 3D models from
                the Fossett Lab's different products: GeoXplorer (for iOS and Hololens) and GeoBase. This swiss-army
                knife approach allows the Lab to scale its operations and not have to worry about serving models
                locally.</p>

            <p>This is a Node.js API that uses express to handle routing, azure-storage to interface with Azure's Blob
                Storage service, streams to reliably move files, and formidable to handle folder uploads to Azure.</p>

            <p>3D models stored in Azure Storage are organized into different folders, depending on the type of model
                being uploaded. Primarily, we have endpoints for each type of category: Digital Elevation Models,
                Martian Terrain (Hi-Rise) models, hand samples, and crystal lattice structures. </p>

            <p>Mad Dash is a Unity-made cops and robbers style game. The player assumes the role of a robber trying to
                avoid the cops while making their way to the safehouse. Along the way, you can collect powerups (such as
                explosive mines, bullets, invisibility cloak, and teleportation) to aid in your escape. The police in
                this game are Unity NavMesh AI Agents that will intelligentially start chasing you if they spot you. Mad
                Dash is composed of 3 levels that you can unlock by getting to the safehouse.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/DavLiet/final_project_457">Github</a>
            <p>Using the d3.js visualization libray, me and two friends made a visualization tool that educates people
                about the effects of gentrification in NYC over time. We focused on identifying 6 key factors that lead
                to gentrification: Housing supply, Commute time, median household income, median rent, population, and
                racial diversity index. We use these factors to calculate a gentrification 'score' that influences the
                color shades of each subborough in the visualization. Darker subboroughs are more gentrified compared to
                lighter ones.</p>

            <p>In addition to seeing the effects of gentrification over time, users can compare 2 subboroughs at a time
                and select specific attributes to analyze. Doing this creates side-by-side bar charts that displays
                fine-grained data from past years.</p>
